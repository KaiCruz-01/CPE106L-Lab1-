Class design serves as the fundamental abstraction mechanism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), enabling the modeling of complex systems by encapsulating data and behavior into reusable structures. A class functions as a blueprint or template, defining the schema of attributes (state) and methods (behavior) without allocating memory for specific instances. The object is the concrete instantiation of this class—akin to constructing a physical house from an architectural blueprint—where the general structure defined by the class is populated with specific data. By bundling these elements, class design enforces encapsulation, ensuring that an object's internal state is manipulated only through defined interfaces, which promotes modularity, data integrity, and scalability within software architecture.
